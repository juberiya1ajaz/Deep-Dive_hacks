# APP NAME

## 💡 Inspiration

We have build a site where people can not only know about the sea animals, but also view and interact with the 3D models and imitate them into real world using AR (Augmented Reality) technology.

## 💻 What it does

Our web app "APP NAME" is built with features:

- After selecting the sea animal user can interact with the 3D model by changing its orientation or zooming in or out.
- User can explore more about the sea animal by clicking on it, such as if you click on the fin of the shark it will give a short description about that
- User can also view all the sea animals in AR (Augmented Reality)

## ⚙️ How we built it

<!-- - ML: Microsoft Cloud(Azure) -->
- Frontend: Wix and Next Js
- Backend: Node Js
- Three Js: Rendering 3D models

## 🌐 Best Use of Velo by Wix

I have to use Velo by Wix to create a website. With Wix Velo, a full-stack development platform, you can create a website without knowing any code. It is a fantastic tool for both experienced developers who want to construct a website quickly and newbies who want to learn how to code. I am using the following features of Velo by Wix:

- **Wix Code**: Helps to add some custom code for implementing Azure API backend for the **Days to decompose** page.
- **Wix Data**: It may be used to both save data in a database and retrieve data from one.
- **Wix Stores**: We may use it to build the store and integrate it with the website.
- **Wix SEO**: I'm using Wix SEO to give the website SEO capability, and we can also use it to give the store SEO functionality.
- **Wix Users**: We may use it to add user functionality to the store in addition to adding user functionality to the website.

<!-- ## ☁ Best Use of Microsoft Cloud for Your Community

I am using Microsoft Azure to train my ML model to find out the specie of animal. I am training my model with Azure Notebooks. My dataset is kept in Azure Blob Storage. I am obtaining the user's image using Azure Cognitive Services. My model was really simple to deploy and train thanks to Microsoft Azure. -->

## 🧠 Challenges we ran into

- Completing the project was a challenge because we had to implement the project by a deadline.
- It was my first time building a backend with Node Js, and learn how to use it with Wix Code.
- It was a bit difficult to implement the Three Js and connecting it with Wix Code.

## 🏅 Accomplishments that we're proud of

- We are proud of the fact that we were able to complete the project in the given time.
<!-- - We are proud of the fact that we were able to build a custom backend with Azure for the web app. -->

## 📖 What we learned

<!-- - How to train a model in Azure. -->
- Managing and handling the backend for Wix.

## 🚀 What's next for APP NAME

- Building a mobile app.
- Creating my ML model.
- Adding more features.
